Code for running the Quantum Neuron Born Machine (QNBM) from [Gili. et al Introducing Non-Linear Activations into Quantum Generative Models. 2022. doi: 10.48550/ARXIV.2205.14506] on the IBM Statevector Simulator as well as Quantinuum's H1 Hardware. The QNBM model can be trained using the statevector simulator and a single run of the model can be implemented on hardware with the optimal parameters.
